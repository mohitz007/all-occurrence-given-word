# all-occurrence-given-word
The python program finds all the occurence of the specified word in all the text files in the given folder.
Just place the main.py in folder from which files are to be read.
Open cmd in that directory and type
"python main.py binod"
(where binod is the string to be counted).
It was developed as "binod" counter but later modified it to find any word.
